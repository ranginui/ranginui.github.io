## The RFP Dance
*by Chris Cormack*

Box-ticking ballet in bureaucrat's prose,\
A thousand pages of "please propose"\
Solutions to problems not quite defined,\
With budgets and timelines left unrefined.

Must have experience in everything new,\
While proving you've done it for decades too,\
Please demonstrate infinite scaling with ease,\
While running on hardware from the nineties.

Your Agile must waterfall into their forms,\
Your innovation must conform to their norms,\
"Define all requirements right from the start!"\
(While we change our minds and move all the parts)

"Show us your processes!" they demand with glee,\
"But fit it in exactly these three sheets, you see,\
And don't forget to include with your bid\
The names of the juniors you haven't yet hired!"

PRINCE2 certified, ISO compliant,\
DevOps and waterfall both in alliance,\
Must integrate smoothly with legacy code\
(That we can't tell you about till you've been showed)

"We want cutting edge!" the document claims,\
While procurement processes from Georgian days\
Ensure that by time the contract is signed\
The technology's several years behind.

"Must be innovative, creative, and new!"\
(But exactly like something we already do)\
"Cloud-native, containerised, readily scaled!"\
(But match our old system down to detail)

The winners announced after months of delay:\
The same vendor chosen who wins every day,\
While somewhere a developer reads with despair\
The requirements doc that gave Product nightmares.
