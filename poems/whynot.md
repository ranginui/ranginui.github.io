breath by breath\
the days slip past\
like sand between fingers\
while tyrants count coins\
and children ask why

we're all just dust\
walking home to stars\
but even dust\
can rise up\
in storms

so what of comfort?\
what of safety?\
what of quiet lives\
lived small?

when truth calls\
from the streets\
when justice whispers\
"now, now, now"\
when hearts know\
the cost of silence

better to burn bright\
than fade quiet\
better to stand tall\
than kneel long\
better to speak fire\
than swallow ashes

because death comes anyway\
but dignity?\
that's a choice we make\
with every rising sun

and if tomorrow\
or next year\
or in some distant dawn\
our time runs out\
let them say:\
"here stood someone\
who chose to live\
completely"
