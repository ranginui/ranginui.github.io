## Monuments to colonisation
*by Chris Cormack*

They ask us to pour millions into glass walls, into artificial heat that cradles flowers stolen from other soils. Each begonia drinks borrowed warmth while our own plants press against the edges of managed gardens, seeking space in their ancestral home. Twenty million dollars to preserve this crystal monument to collection, to keeping, to the magpie habits of empire. The botanists came with their specimen jars, their careful labels, their Latin names that wrote over indigenous knowledge. Now we maintain their legacy in climate-controlled rooms, proud of our ability to make foreign things bloom in constructed seasons. Meanwhile, harakeke whispers its own names to the wind, kōwhai drops its gold on unmowed grass, and pūriri dreams of forests that once stretched unbroken to the sea. What could we grow, if we redirected these rivers of money to indigenous wisdom? What gardens might flourish if we invested in knowledge that grew from this soil, in plants that remember the taste of this rain? Instead, we polish the windows of our inherited greenhouse, watching condensation bead like tears on panes that separate us from our own earth. The cost of maintaining distance grows higher each year, while the price of reconnection remains uncounted.
