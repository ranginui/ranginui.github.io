# T큰turu take 2
*by Chris Cormack*

They want me to smile and nod\
To let the wrong words flow past\
Like water over stone\
"Don't make waves," they say\
"Be professional"\
As if professionalism means\
Swallowing truth whole

But my t카puna didn't cross oceans\
So I could choke on silence\
They didn't fight for their reo\
So I could whisper "yes"\
When my heart screams "k훮ore"

You call it kindness\
This soft agreement\
This gentle lie\
This smooth corporate face

But I call it violence\
Against truth\
Against self\
Against everything we stand for

Real aroha has teeth\
Real manaaki has backbone\
Sometimes the kindest thing\
Is to plant your feet like kauri roots\
Look them in the eye\
And say\
"Not like this"\
"Not here"\
"Not on my watch"

Because being t큰turu\
Isn't just about being true to yourself\
It's about being true to everyone\
Who comes after\
Everyone who needs to know\
That sometimes\
The kindest voice\
Is the one that says\
"No"
