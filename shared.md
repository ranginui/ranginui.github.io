# Shared Horizons: Māori and Palestine
*by Chris Cormack*

From Aotearoa's shores to Gaza's ancient sands,\
Indigenous voices rise across divided lands.\
Two stories distant yet bound by common thread:\
The right to walk ancestral soil without dread.

The Māori call of "Tino Rangatiratanga"\
Echoes in Arabic across Mediterranean waters—\
Self-determination, the birthright of all peoples,\
A flame that burns in marae and in mosque steeples.

When British ships claimed what was never theirs to own,\
They planted flags in soil where generations had grown.\
The same colonial logic, different century, different name,\
The displacement of the tangata whenua—the pattern remains the same.

In Palestine, the olive groves tell stories just as old\
As the kauri trees that watched Māori history unfold.\
Land is never just land but identity, memory, and right—\
What was taken by power can be reclaimed by light.

"Until we are all free, we are none of us free,"\
Emma Lazarus, Jewish poet, wrote prophetically.\
Her words a bridge between struggles, a testament\
That justice cannot be sectioned or fragment.

The haka and the dabke, dances of resistance,\
Cultural preservation as form of persistence.\
Language revived despite attempts to silence tongue—\
Te reo Māori and Arabic, from ancient wisdom sprung.

Treaty of Waitangi, promises made and broken;\
UN resolutions, words repeatedly unspoken.\
Ink on paper means nothing without justice in deed,\
Both peoples know the gap between promise and need.

From the Kia Ora to As-salamu alaykum,\
Greetings that carry hopes for peace to come.\
When Māori stand for Palestine, when struggles intertwine,\
The world glimpses truth in Lazarus's line.

For liberty is not a privilege reserved for some,\
But a universal right from which justice must come.\
And until every Indigenous child is free to roam\
The land of their ancestors they rightfully call home,

The struggle continues, the solidarity grows,\
Māori and Palestinian, facing common foes.\
Not just against oppressors but systems that divide,\
The colonial mindset that power seeks to hide.

"Until we are all free, we are none of us free."\
Not just poetic words but a shared destiny.\
When dawn breaks over Aotearoa and Palestine too,\
May it illuminate a world made whole and new.
