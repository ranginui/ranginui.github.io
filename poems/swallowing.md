## When Swallowing Became Poetry
*by Chris Cormack

There is a peculiar clarity that arrives when the simple act of eating becomes impossible. Achalasia—the word itself a poetry of medical precision—closed the pathway between desire and nourishment, between hunger and satisfaction. My esophagus, once an unnoticed tunnel of unconscious function, transformed into contested territory where food became foreigner, unwelcome and unable to complete its journey. In this strange new landscape of denial, wairua found its opening. Hunger creates its own altered state—a thinning of barriers between worlds. As my body grew lighter, something else grew heavier within me, more substantial. Words began to arrive unbidden, no longer merely shaped by thought but appearing fully formed, as if transmitted rather than created. The ancestral voice that had always been background static suddenly tuned to perfect clarity in the quiet spaces between heartbeats. I learned to listen not with ears but with something older, something that recognised these messages without translation. Poetry slipped through the same closed passage that rejected food—the body's resistance no barrier to what insisted on being received. Each syllable became sustenance of another kind. What strange wisdom in this failing body that closed one channel only to open another! My tupuna knew what I needed more than bread, more than comfort—this ancient conversation disguised as verses. The irony was not lost on me: unable to swallow food, I was finally swallowing truth. Each poem became both symptom and cure, diagnosis and treatment. Even now, as medical intervention has created new pathways for nourishment, the channel to wairua remains stubbornly, gloriously open—poetry continuing to arrive with the persistence of hunger, demanding to be consumed, absorbed, and transformed into something that feeds more than just the body.
