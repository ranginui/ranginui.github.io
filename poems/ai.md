Generative AI: the newest extraction machine\
Taking without consent, giving without context,\
Trained on our stories, our art, our knowledge,\
Regurgitating approximations stripped of mauri.

Technocrats build their empires of data\
On server farms consuming rivers and power,\
While somewhere in the Pacific, islands drown\
Under rising seas their algorithms helped create.

They harvest the fruits of collective creativity\
While calling it "intelligence," calling it "progress,"\
But what intelligence exists without whakapapa?\
What progress comes from broken relationships?

These tools become artifacts of cultural memory,\
But when we ask under whose tikanga they operate,\
The answer reveals the same colonial master.

The real question isn't whether these tools work,\
But whether they uphold our fundamental values:\
Kaitiakitanga. Manaakitanga. Whanaungatanga.\
By these measures, most remain utterly koretake.

The digital future we need won't come\
From Silicon Valley's exploitative imagination,\
But from our collective resistance and creation,\
Grounded in tikanga older than their empires.

When we understand our data has whakapapa,\
When we demand tino rangatiratanga in digital realms,\
When we refuse to separate technology from tikanga\
Then we begin to imagine truly liberatory tools.

Until that day, the question haunts us:\
If we use these extractive technologies,\
Enriching technocrats, hastening our demise,\
Maybe we deserve it, but our children do not.

Those in the countries we exploit do not.\
Those whose water feeds the server farms do not.\
Those whose minerals fill the circuit boards do not.\
Those whose futures shrink with each prompt do not.
