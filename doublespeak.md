## "Double Speak"
*by Chris Cormack*

"I'm not for colonisation," comes their plea\
While nodding as homes crumble by the sea,\
"It's complicated," they declare with care\
As children's shelters vanish in thin air.

"Both sides, both sides," they thoughtfully opine\
While one side's water's cut, one drinks fine wine, \
"Who really is to blame?" they ask, wide-eyed\
As olive groves are bulldozed far and wide.

"Historical context," they love to say\
While present crimes unfold day after day,\
"Peace must come first," they righteously decree\
While backing force against the ones not free.

Their rhetoric spins like desert sand\
While settlements expand across the land,\
Such brazen doublethink upon display -\
These peace-lovers who love war's way.
