## Quantum superpositions 
*by Chris Cormack*

In quantum realms, particles dance\
Like the stories of Tāne:\
Present in all places at once,\
Until observed, until named,\
Until karakia calls them into being.

Our tūpuna always knew\
About entanglement\
How a kupu spoken on Aoraki\
Ripples through Te Waipounamu,\
How a change in one part\
Changes the whole.\
No separation possible\
In te ao Māori,\
Just as quantum pairs remain connected\
Across any distance.

Schrödinger never knew\
His cat walked paths\
Our tohunga understood:\
The space between states,\
Where something is both\
And neither,\
Like the moment between\
Te Kore and Te Pō,\
Where infinite potential\
Dwells in darkness,\
Waiting to manifest,\
Each possibility a seed\
In the void's fertile soil.\
Where all possibilities exist\
In sacred suspension.

In the quantum labs\
Built on returned whenua,\
Rangatahi write equations\
That describe particle spin\
In the language of poi,\
Finding in quaternions\
The mathematics of wero,\
While their instruments detect\
What tohunga always saw:\
The underlying unity\
Of all things.

Wave functions collapse\
Like fishing nets drawn tight,\
But memory remains\
In superposition\
Past and future tangled\
Like roots of kahikatea,\
Supporting each other\
Through shared quantum fields\
And shared whakapapa.

Probabilities spread\
Like ripples on water,\
Each possibility a pathway\
Through space-time\
Like the many routes\
Māui took to catch the sun,\
All existing simultaneously\
Until story fixes them in place.

This is how our ancestors\
Read the stars, the seeds,\
The flight of birds\
Understanding that truth,\
Like light,\
Can be both wave and particle,\
Both here and there,\
Both story and fact,\
Both ancient and yet to come.
