in the grey-walled room
                    where words shape futures
they say: don't call us racist
                    (it's unhelpful)
                    (it's unproductive)
                    (it assumes bad faith)

mate,
let's talk about bad faith

remember how they took the tamariki
scraped the reo from their tongues
called it civilisation?
                    that was white supremacy

remember how they said
be more like us
                    speak like us
                    think like us
                    exist
                    like
                    us?

and now
in your gleaming offices
with your crisp papers
and measured words
you're saying:

these principles need "clarifying"
                    need "modernising"
                    need whitening
                    (though you won't say that part)

you bristle at "racist"
while pushing bills
that would dissolve difference
into your idealised sameness

colonisation doesn't always wear
a red coat and a musket—
sometimes it comes in A4 pages
bound with good intentions

don't tell us we're being unfair
when we name the whakapapa
of your "reasonable suggestions"

your offence at being called racist
while cloaking assimilation
in parliamentary language
is just
                    white
                            supremacy
                                        in a tie
