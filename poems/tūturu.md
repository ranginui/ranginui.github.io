# T큰turu
*by Chris Cormack*

In the space between yes and no\
there is a moment\
when you can choose\
to be what others want\
or who you are

Some call it gentle\
to smile and nod\
to let the tide of wrong\
wash over stone\
wearing it smooth\
until nothing remains

But I have seen\
the strength in standing\
the aroha in saying\
"k훮ore"\
when k훮ore is needed

There is more mana \
in one true word\
than a thousand\
comfortable lies

This is how we honour\
the ones who came before\
and the ones yet to come\
by being t큰turu\
even when it stings
