## Te Hokinga mai
*By Chris Cormack*

Beneath the skin of Papatūānuku, karanga echo\
Through whenua that remembers\
Before survey pegs and paper deeds,\
When Te Tiriti was more than words,\
When partnership meant standing together\
Like kauri and kahikatea.

In council chambers and courtrooms\
Waitangi's promises whisper still,\
While on marae, kaumātua speak\
Of maunga sold for copper pennies,\
Of whanga choked with reclamation,\
Of awa diverted from ancient paths.

But listen - through concrete and colonial law,\
Mauri flows strong as ever,\
Pōhutukawa roots crack colonial foundations,\
Pushing through like revolution,\
Red flowers bleeding history into harbour.

On seized land, now returned,\
Kaitiaki plant tomorrow's rongoā,\
Their hands remember what textbooks forgot:\
The way to read the moods of Tāwhirimātea,\
How to honour rāhui and seasons,\
The rhythm of karakia at dawn.

In treaty settlements and land occupations,\
In kōhanga reo and kura kaupapa,\
In every "kia ora" spoken proud in parliament,\
Power shifts like tide returning to shore.\
Place names shed their colonial clothes:\
Aoraki stands tall again,\
Not the shadow of some English captain.

This is not about erasing tauiwi,\
But weaving new patterns in old whāriki,\
Finding space in the wharenui\
For all who honour te ao Māori,\
Who understand that ownership\
Means less than belonging.

In this time of awakening,\
We are all called to be kaingaki māra,\
To unpick the tangled roots of crown law\
And plant seeds of tino rangatiratanga\
In soil that remembers its first karakia,\
Its first and truest names.

Ka hoki mai te mana,\
Ki te whenua,\
Ki te marae,\
Ki te iwi.\
Tihei mauri ora!
