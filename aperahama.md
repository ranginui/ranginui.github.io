## Te Kaiwhakamarumaru
*by Chris Cormack*


At sacred Waitangi, where treaties sleep\
In day's light, where ancestors weep,\
A man stood proud with poisoned tongue\
While nearby, our tamariki young

Aperahama, up he rose\
To shield young ears from hatred's prose\
For as our t큰puna always say:\
"Guard well the words our children weigh"

You speak of freedom, white-collar clean\
While spreading lies like a machine\
Pretending wisdom, claiming right\
To wound our people in broad daylight

You say we "suppress" - but understand\
We've heard such rhetoric on our land\
Since ships first touched these sacred shores\
With "civilising" in their cores

Our kaum훮tua taught us well\
Some words are poison, some words spell\
The death of dreams in children's hearts\
When hatred's arrow finds its marks

So stand there with your false acclaim\
Of "freedom" - we know your game\
For generations we have seen\
The wolf who claims his teeth are clean

Kaua e wareware\
The wisdom of our people here:\
It's not suppression when we shield\
The future from your bitter yield

T큰turu whakamaua kia tina\
Tina!\
Haumi e, hui e\
T훮iki e!
