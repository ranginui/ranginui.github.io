# The Weight of Silence

In that moment of acquiescence,
When my pen struck through truth,
I did not hear the sound of my own voice fading.

One small erasure—
What harm could come
From a single absence on a single page?

But silence compounds silence,
And the weight of what remains unsaid
Grows heavier with each passing day.

I carry it now, this ghost of words,
This emptiness where conviction once stood,
A hollow space that echoes with distant screams.

What is the cost of comfort?
I have measured it in children's names,
In rubble that was once a home.

The ink I used to cross out suffering
Has stained my hands regardless,
A mark no scrubbing will remove.

History watches, and remembers
Not just what was done,
But what was allowed by looking away.

If I could return to that moment—
The paper before me, the pressure around me,
Would I find the courage that failed me then?

To speak is to risk,
But to remain silent is to consent.
This is the lesson I learn anew each morning.

So let this lament be the beginning,
Not of absolution, but of resolve.
The next time truth needs a voice,
May mine be steady enough to offer it.
