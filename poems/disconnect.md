## Mediterranean Railway
*by Chris Cormack*

I will arrive in Barcelona, city of impossible curves,\
where Gaudí's visions stretch like strange trees toward heaven.\
One week to wander La Rambla, to trace my fingers\
along stone walls older than my country.\
No work phone will buzz in my pocket,\
no laptop will weigh down my shoulders—\
just eyes wide open to Gothic quarters and seaside air.

Then the train will pull away, rhythmic and sure,\
carrying me across borders to Nîmes for a single day,\
where Roman ghosts still pace their arena,\
and I will pace with them, unencumbered by deadlines,\
my time finally my own to spend like ancient coins.

The rails will guide me onward to Marseille,\
where friends and Koha wait—not as work\
but as shared passion, our fingers building bridges\
of knowledge instead of answering emails.\
For one whole week, collaboration without obligation,\
our minds meeting in person instead of across screens.

Another train journey to Perpignan,\
the brief sweetness of a single day\
where France and Spain have whispered secrets to each other\
across centuries. I will listen to their conversation,\
storing memories no cloud could hold.

The final train will return me to Barcelona,\
the circle nearly complete.\
These tracks will carry me between cities
and carry me back to myself,\
this holiday without digital tethers
the truest journey of all.

In the train window, my reflection will smile\
over landscapes of vine and stone and sea.\
Then I'll fly home, but something essential will remain\
in these Mediterranean cities,\
and something essential will return with me.
