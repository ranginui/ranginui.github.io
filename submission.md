in the grey-walled room\
                    where words shape\ futures\
they say: don't call us racist\
                    (it's unhelpful)\
                    (it's unproductive)\
                    (it assumes bad faith)

mate,\
let's talk about bad faith—

remember how they took the tamariki\
scraped the reo from their tongues\
called it civilisation?\
                    that was white supremacy

remember how they said\
be more like us\
                    speak like us\
                    think like us\
                    exist\
                    like\
                    us?

and now\
in your gleaming offices\
with your crisp papers\
and measured words\
you're saying:

these principles need "clarifying"\
                    need "modernising"\
                    need whitening\
                    (though you won't say that part)

you bristle at "racist"\
while pushing bills\
that would dissolve difference\
into your idealised sameness

colonisation doesn't always wear\
a red coat and a musket—\
sometimes it comes in A4 pages\
bound with good intentions

don't tell us we're being unfair\
when we name the whakapapa\
of your "reasonable suggestions"

your offence at being called racist\
while cloaking assimilation\
in parliamentary language\
is just\
                    white\
                            supremacy\
                                        in a tie
