## The Last Stand of Yesterday's Guard
*by Chris Cormack*

Watch them squirm in leather chairs,\
Clutching pearls and splitting hairs,\
"But what of merit?" comes their shriek,\
As privilege makes their voices weak.

They craft their memos, draft their screed,\
"Diversity's gone mad!" they plead,\
While hiding quotas of their own:\
"He looks just like me" set in stone.

Their arguments, a house of cards,\
Built in country club backyards,\
Where nephews land the centre stage,\
Through networks built in gilded cage.

See Silicon Valley's finest hour:\
Tech lords drunk on newfound power,\
Axing truth and DEI,\
To let their bias amplify.

Like billionaires who buy their toys,\
Then break them with their tantrum noise,\
(See X, where trolls now freely soar,\
While progress shows them to the door).

In Meta's halls and Facebook's feeds,\
They plant their algorithmic seeds,\
Where facts become opcional things,\
And bias spreads on viral wings.

They claim a meritocracy,\
While batting down each scrutiny,\
Of how they reached their lofty height:\
Inheritance and birthright's might.

In boardrooms, blogs, and echo halls,\
They rally 'round their crumbling walls,\
Like dinosaurs who'd curse the comet,\
With lawyers' letters vomit-prompt.

Each measure meant to level plains,\
Brings forth their performative pains,\
"Reverse discrimination!" howl\
The ones who've rigged the game so foul.

Their children write diversity\
In applications, presently,\
While Daddy's cheque ensures their spotâ€”\
"Legacy entry" masks the plot.

But time moves like a wrecking ball,\
No tech-bro empire stops its fall,\
Their resistance, rank and bitter,\
Makes their irrelevance yet fitter.

Let history record their stance:\
Last soldiers in a dead romance,\
Who'd rather burn the house to ground,\
Than share the space they never found.

For all their tantrums, fits and fights,\
Can't stop tomorrow's dawning lights,\
Their power, built on shifting sand,\
Slips through their grasping, grasping hand.
