# Building on Whenua
*by Chris Cormack*

In the hum of servers\
our data flows like streams\
but where does it rest?\
Not overseas, not in distant cloudsâ€”\
here, on our whenua\
where our stories belong

We speak of co-design\
but whose voice carries?\
whose wisdom shapes?\
In a society built on stolen land\
participation without equity\
is just another colonial game

Every line of code bears witness\
to the hands that wrote it\
to the minds that shaped it\
to the system that birthed it

When you type 'Te'\
does your database understand\
that this is not just a prefix\
but part of a name that flows\
like water through generations?

Your dropdown menus cannot contain\
the multitude of iwi connections\
your binary systems cannot grasp\
the complexity of being

Remember:\
neutral technology \
is a myth we tell ourselves\
to sleep better at night

Before you build\
before you type\
before you deploy\
ask yourself:

whose land hosts your servers?\
whose stories are you coding?\
whose future are you compiling?

Sometimes the bravest code\
is the code unwritten\
Sometimes the strongest design\
is saying 'no'

Let your software speak\
of sovereignty\
of mana\
of tikanga

But first\
listen\
to the land\
to the people\
to the silence between your keystrokes
