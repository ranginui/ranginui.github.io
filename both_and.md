## Both/And
*by Chris Cormack*

Your pronouns matter\
         (don't let them tell you otherwise)\
Your right to exist in your own skin matters\
         Your bathroom rights matter\
                  Your sport matters\
                           Your dignity matters

AND

They know this\
They know how deep these waters run\
How essential these battles are\
So they steal our righteous anger\
         package it\
                  sell it back to us\
                           twisted

They take real pain\
         real struggle\
                  real lives\
And turn them into clickbait\
         engagement metrics\
                  shareholder value

They platform bigots who claim to care\
about women's sports\
         (never watched a match)\
about children's safety\
         (while cutting school lunches)\
about tradition\
         (which tradition?)\
about merit\
         (inherited wealth speaks)

Your gender matters\
AND they use it to distract from their theft\
Your ethnicity matters\
AND they use it to hide their plunder\
Your sexuality matters\
AND they rainbow-wash their exploitation

They understand\
         the power of identity\
         the strength of community\
         the force of belonging\
So they fragment it\
         monetise it\
         squeeze it through their algorithms

Watch them fake-champion\
         real causes\
Watch them diamond-hands\
         your pain\
Watch them profit from\
         necessary battles

Trans rights matter\
AND workers' rights matter\
Racial justice matters\
AND housing justice matters\
Gender equity matters\
AND wealth inequality matters

They want us to choose\
         either/or\
When the truth is\
         both/and

They understand intersectionality\
         better than they admit\
That's why they work so hard\
         to break its power

Your pronouns matter\
Your wages matter\
Your healthcare matters\
Your housing matters\
Your future matters

Everything they mock\
         matters\
Everything they trivialise\
         matters\
Everything they weaponise\
         matters

AND

Their profit margins\
         shouldn't
