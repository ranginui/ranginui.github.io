## The Innovation Vampires
*by Chris Cormack*

They call themselves visionaries, founders, pioneers\
These buyers of others' blood, sweat, and years,\
With daddy's emerald mines and family ties,\
They purchase the truth, then promote their lies.

"I built this empire!" the parasites crow,\
While actual builders toil down below,\
The coders, designers, the ones who create,\
Get edited out at a corporate rate.

See them strutting on stages so wide,\
Original founders pushed off to the side,\
"I dreamed up this platform!" they brazenly claim,\
While purchasing patents and others' good name.

Remember the faces you'll never see praised:\
The women, the immigrants, voices erased,\
Who sparked the ideas, wrote elegant code,\
Before golden parachutes helped them unload.

Their "genius" is simply a chequebook unfurled,\
"Disruption" means breaking what works in the world,\
They'll purchase your platform, then make it much worse,\
While media claims them a blessing, not curse.

The Silicon Emperor's clothes are so fine!\
(Just don't check the labels, or read the design)\
They're wearing the garments of thousands unknown,\
While claiming they stitched every button alone.

Their "morning routines" in magazines shine:\
"Up at 4 AM, that's how I align!"\
But truth would show meetings where others present\
The work that they'll claim in the next media event.

They'll cosplay as engineers, nerds who made good,\
In hoodies and sneakers, as if they once stood\
In graduate housing or garage workspace,\
Instead of the boardrooms that birthed their embrace.

Some bought in so early, they almost forget\
The actual founders they rushed to reset,\
"It's practically same as inventing!" they'll say,\
While history's editors help their display.

Each earnings call builds up their elegant fraud:\
"My genius" gets all of the media applaud,\
While teams of true builders get stock options cheap,\
And NDAs ensure their silence runs deep.

But time has a way of revealing the truth,\
These emperors' nakedness shows in their youth:\
No coding at midnight, no engineering degree,\
Just privilege and purchase, then marketing spree.

So let's praise the builders whose names we don't know,\
The ones who created, but had to let go,\
Their innovations, bought out and rebadged,\
By billionaire egos so fragile and staged.

For true innovation grows wild and free,\
Not captured in stock splits and CEO fees,\
These vampires of venture can purchase their fame,\
But history knows better than corporate acclaim.
