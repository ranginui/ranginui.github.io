## A Sound in the Sand
*by Chris Cormack*

Where the beach meets the harbour's hand,\
There's more than just grains of sandâ€”\
A name sits strange upon the tongue,\
Empty letters where meaning once hung.

Pito one, they wished to say again,\
Where sand meets shore, where stories begin,\
A name that speaks of place and time,\
Not colonial letters, stripped of rhyme.

The people gathered, voices clear,\
"Let's bring the true name near."\
From council chambers to street-side talks,\
The old name in new voices walks.

But one man's pen drew a line in sand,\
Against the wishes of the land.\
While Petone stays, hollow and bare,\
Pito one whispers still in the air.

For names are more than letters strung,\
They're stories waiting to be sung,\
They're bridges to what came before,\
Footprints on memory's shore.

Though signs may read what they've always read,\
The true name lives in hearts instead,\
For those who know, who understand:\
Pito one the end of the sand.
