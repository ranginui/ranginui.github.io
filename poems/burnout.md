# The Weight of Tomorrow's Promise
*by Chris Cormack*

The fire that once burned bright within\
Now flickers, wavering in winds of resistance.\
I carry the dreams of my tīpuna on weary shoulders,\
Their whispers grow faint beneath the noise of systems unchanged.

Each morning I wake to rebuild what was taken,\
To explain, defend, translate between worlds.\
The words "partnership" and "rangatiratanga" \
Hollow echoes in meeting rooms where decisions are made.

They say, "You speak so well," as if surprise\
Is the appropriate response to generations of wisdom.\
I become the face, the voice, the token\
In spaces not built with us in mind.

My wairua stretches thin across too many battles,\
Like water spreading across parched earth,\
Not enough to quench the thirst of all\
Who look to me for sustenance.

At night, the weight of unfinished work\
Sits heavy on my chest, stealing sleep.\
The emails, the calls, the constant proving\
That our ways have value, our knowledge matters.

This burnout is not simply exhaustion\
It is the accumulated grief of watching\
The slow violence of colonisation continue\
While we fight with diminishing strength.

But still, like the ahi kā, something remains.\
A stubborn ember refusing to die out.\
For what is this weariness compared to what was endured\
By those who cleared the path I now walk?

I will rest, but not retreat.\
Gather strength from the whenua beneath my feet.\
Tomorrow I'll return to the work undone,\
For my mokopuna, not yet born, are waiting.
