## Return to Te Aro
*By Chris Cormack*

Between Te Ahumairangi's clouded height\
And harbour waters churning winter-grey,\
We thread through Willis, where the wind holds sway\
Past ghosts of Te Aro pā's ancient site.

Three weeks of rest dissolve in morning's light—\
Forgot passwords, meetings gone astray,\
While southerlies mock summer's delayed stay,\
And email inboxes loom infinite.

Yet in this space where once the flat stretched free,\
Before reclamation changed the shore,\
The spirits of Te Āti Awa see

Us hurry through these glass-wrapped corridors.\
Below sealed streets, old streams still seek the sea,\
While stories from Tāngata whenua claim these floors.
