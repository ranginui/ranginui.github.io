## He Ako, He Ora
*by Chris Cormack*

In the space between screens and stars\
We learn as our tūpuna did—\
By doing, by being, by sharing breath and thought,\
No walls between teacher and learner,\
No artificial hierarchies of knowing.

The kuia watches the fingers of mokopuna\
Dance across holographic keys,\
Coding ancient karakia into quantum space,\
While she whispers the true names of winds\
That her grandmother's grandmother knew.\
Together they weave new patterns\
From old knowledge and fresh discovery.

In the innovation hub\
(Built on land returned, restored, remembered)\
Rangatahi teach professors\
How quantum superposition echoes\
The way our tūpuna understood\
A thing could be both here and there,\
Now and then, one and many.\
While learning why the tōtara\
Grows just so on this hillside.\
Knowledge flows like wai,\
Finding its own levels,\
Nourishing as it passes.

Some days the ākonga leads,\
Their fresh eyes seeing new paths\
Through ancient mazes.\
Some days the tuakana guides,\
Their wisdom illuminating\
Shadows cast by progress.

In virtual wānanga,\
Distance dissolves like morning mist—\
A kaumātua in Hokianga\
Shares rongoā wisdom\
With students in Rakiura,\
While they show him how their drones\
Track whale migrations,\
Each learning from each,\
All growing together.

This is how we always meant to learn:\
Like harakeke clusters,\
The old and new shoots\
Supporting each other,\
Every frond both giving\
And receiving strength,\
No separation between\
Teacher and taught,\
Just wisdom finding\
Its natural flow\
Through generations\
Like tides through mangroves—\
Constant, circular,\
Eternal.
