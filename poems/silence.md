# The Weight of Silence

In that moment of acquiescence,\
When my pen struck through truth,\
I did not hear the sound of my own voice fading.

One small erasure\
What harm could come\
From a single absence on a single page?

But silence compounds silence,\
And the weight of what remains unsaid\
Grows heavier with each passing day.

I carry it now, this ghost of words,\
This emptiness where conviction once stood,\
A hollow space that echoes with distant screams.

What is the cost of comfort?\
I have measured it in children's names,\
In rubble that was once a home.

The ink I used to cross out suffering\
Has stained my hands regardless,\
A mark no scrubbing will remove.

History watches, and remembers\
Not just what was done,\
But what was allowed by looking away.

If I could return to that moment—\
The paper before me, the pressure around me,\
Would I find the courage that failed me then?

To speak is to risk,\
But to remain silent is to consent.\
This is the lesson I learn anew each morning.

So let this lament be the beginning,\
Not of absolution, but of resolve.\
The next time truth needs a voice,\
May mine be steady enough to offer it.
