# January 26th
*by Chris Cormack*

They raise their beers to invasion\
On stolen beaches, dancing\
Where blood once soaked the sand\
"Happy Australia Day!" they cry\
Through mouthfuls of barbecued denial

What celebration is this\
That begins with ships and ends in chains?\
That starts with gunfire\
And continues in statistics:\
Four percent remaining

Their flags snap like whips\
In the summer breeze\
Red for the blood they won't acknowledge\
White for the history they sanitised\
Blue for the seas that brought their ships

They vote on someone else's grief\
Pass surveys around suburban homes\
Built on sacred ground\
"Majority rules!" they declare\
From Parliament House to Bondi Beach

Tell me what right\
Has the grandson of the thief\
To declare the robbery\
A public holiday?\
To paint victory over genocide\
In firework colours?

Some dates are not for claiming\
Some wounds not for rebranding\
Some days cannot be seized\
Like the land was seized\
By those who'd dare call murder\
A cause for celebration
